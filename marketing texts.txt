	vote based on record, not TV commercials
	
	
Election reform
1.  Eliminate parties
2.  Vote based on direct experience of the candidates performance and voting history, not on TV commercials.
3.  Vote locally.  Leave other jurisdictions to their own devices.
4.  Remove the money.  Do we really want our leaders to be rich guys?
